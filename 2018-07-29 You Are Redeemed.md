# You are Redeemed!
## Colossians 1:18-22


Many effects of Adam's sin:

1. Guilty of breaking God’s law and deserving eternal death as penalty for our sin.
2. Slave to sin, can’t free ourselves from obeying sin and Satan.
3. Polluted and defiled by sin, we are unclean before a holy God and conscience echoes.
4. Separated from God, alienated. Enemy, not a friend.

Post sin has estranged Adam, made him afraid to face God. But it also caused God to be alienated from man, God cast mankind out of the garden.

### 1. Once you were

#### Let's get personal - "And you"

God's reconciliation is directed not just to all things in general, but personally **for you.**

Once you were -- former condition -- but not what you are, before God got a hold of you.

#### In mind - alienated and hostile

Because we are alienated, man is no longer in harmony with God.

Because we are hostile, God bothers us; we do not want Him as our authority.

#### In actions - doing evil

We don't set out to do evil, but that is what we inevitably do. This is what distances us from God.

### 2. Now He has reconciled you

Not about you, God has done it. Man didn't want anything to do with this. Only God could reconcile man; the cost was too high.

#### How? In the body of his flesh by death

Jesus Christ, the sinless one, came physically as a fleshly body and took our place to bear our sins, to pay for our sin, to suffer for our sin, to become our sin.

v20 - to reconcile all things. Much in the future
v21 - he has now reconciled -- done in Christ, right now, done in you. The change is dramatic.

#### Why? To present you holy

This is God's purpose. To make you holy, blameless, above reproach. 

All of God's purpose telescopes into this -- to present us before God as completely holy.

This is not just about our current happiness, but about our increasing holiness, which leads to our greatest happiness.

**Come to this God who lives, gives, offers peace, forgiveness and a new relationship with God.**
