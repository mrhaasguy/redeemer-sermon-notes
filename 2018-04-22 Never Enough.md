# Never Enough
## John 6:1-15

The Soul of man is like a sponge, it is always thirsting and sucking for something to fill itself.

This is who we are.

Jesus claims to be the only one who can satisfy this.

### A Miraculous Introduction
Why was the feeding of so many an introduction?

1. This is a natural lead-in to the rest of the chapter.
2. Physical bread contrasted w/ spiritual bread.
3. It worked -- it got people interested.

### An Extreme Hunger

Jesus recognizes the extreme physical hunger in the people. Which he addresses.

But He was also aware of their spiritual hunger, which He also addresses and meets.

Everyone gets hungry. Why? It should show us our neediness. 

### A Complete Lack of Resources

Jesus tests his disciples to show them their need for Him.

The disciples had nothing; Jesus had everything.

Jesus says - You don't need your resources, or your money, I will provide.

Jesus wants us to lead us into a life of complete dependence on Him, so we don't get caught up on who we are and all of our failures!

### An Invitation to His Table

The people came with extreme hunger, and Jesus powerfully provides for his people over-abundantly. 

There is bread from another world that will truly fill you and satisfy your desires!

### The Bread From Another World

Whoever simply comes, I will give this feast for you, I will satisfy this hunger, I will give you life.

Through His death. In love Jesus offers himself. The One who is perfect, without sin, the one who endured the punishment of our sin and the curse of the law -- by hanging in agony on the cross and dying a criminals death.

## Final thoughts

Only Jesus satisfies, and he satisfies forever.

Why then do we look for satisfaction in all the wrong places? We have an enemy, Satan, who wants us to look in all the wrong places.

    Often we find our satisfaction in not just the bad things, but the good things -- religious devotion, love for others.

**Our call is to find satisfaction in Jesus alone**, not anything we do whether good or bad.

If we find our satisfaction in other things, it lead to moral failure and destruction.

    We must locate the bread.

We may be tempted to connect good things to the goodness of God. "I have a good marriage, Isn't God good?".

Yes, these are wonderful gifts, but these things do not define God's goodness.

    You're a Christian, you know the promise of Jesus is true, but why do I still not feel satisfied, why am I still drawn away?

2 Peter 1:3-10

You must step into and lean into the promises. You must grow in knowledge, increase in self control, work. Then you will experience more of who Jesus is.

Hebrews 4:1-2

You need faith. Romans 10:17

As we get older in the faith, we start to *know* these things, even when we don't *feel* it.

May we be a people who step into that life -- in faith -- trusting in him -- living in the delight of the fountain of living waters -- experiencing the joy of living w/ Jesus throughout all of our days.
