# The Focus of our Lament
## Psalm 4

If we learn to lament in our suffering, we will look very different from the world. **Why?** Lamenting is a realistic response to suffering, and it focuses on and emphasized faith in God.

### 1. God and Our Lament

1. God is our God of righteousness. He is right in everything He does. He makes promises and keeps them.
2. God is the God who has given me relief in the past.
3. God is the God who hears and answers prayers.

It is nice to have a shoulder to cry on, someone to physically hear and sympathize w/ us, but it cannot stop there.

### 2. Detractors and Our Lament

1. He addresses the Adversaries and Liars (verses 2-3)
2. He addresses the Independent Hot-Heads (allies who want to take matters into their own hands instead of waiting on the Lord) (verses 4-5)
3. He addresses the Doubters (allies who doubt the Lord will help) (verses 6)

### 3. The Future and Our Lament

There is a true real lasting joy that isn't changed by circumstances, which David speaks of at the end of this psalm.

### Take-aways

1. In lament, we must remember both the real suffering and the certain hope.
2. In lament, our focus is on God and our hope is in Jesus Christ.
3. God uses difficulty in our lives to give us grace and to grant us a platform for witness in this secular age.
4. Our way forward: **pray, lament,** and **sing**.
