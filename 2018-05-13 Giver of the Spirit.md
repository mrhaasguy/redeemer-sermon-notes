# Giver of the Spirit
## John 7

John wrote this gospel to promote what Jesus said in spite of much persecution or difficulty. John lived w/ Him, and knew Him personally, and gave His life for Him.

John 7 is in the middle of what many refer to as his "Book of Signs"

It is starting to point to the life inside us, the Holy Spirit.

### The Value of Understanding the Feast of Booths

The Feast of Booths was a harvest feast for the Jews.
They would come to Jerusalem for a week and build little booths to live in while they are there. Something like "camping"

The booths were built in a special way to remind them about their wandering in the wilderness and how God provided for them every step of the way.

At the end of the feast, Jesus stood up and basically said "This is all about me!"

### Three Wrong Reactions
**A) Bossy Little Brothers**

Jesus's brothers were saying "Don't speak like 'eat my flesh' and 'drink my blood', that is scaring people off, but if what you are saying about yourself is true then go to the feast where everybody is and become popular."

But Jesus was not trying to get popular and gather a crowd of followers. His message was not popular, or fun, but it was life-giving and world-transforming

**B) Jealous Jews**

The Jews wanted to kill Him.

Why? Because Jesus was challenging their authority and preaching a different message. He was threatening their idol (popularity among the people).

**C) Confused Crowds**

The crowds didn't know what to think. Was He good? Was He bad?

No one wanted to look into it further, for fear of the Jewish leaders.

### The Clarity of Jesus Christ
**A) He is the Sent One of God on mission in this world**

His mission was to save the world.

**B) He is the Giver of the Holy Spirit**

Self-fulfillment only comes through this Gift of Jesus.

It is not just a superficial change, it is **real** change.

Jesus offers not only life, but the Holy Spirit, who gives us the power to live completely differently. Not just a mindset change, but the power of the Spirit.

By the Spirit we are actually able to love each other.
