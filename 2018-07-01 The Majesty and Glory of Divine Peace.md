# The Majesty & Glory of Divine Peace

Joyfully revel in King Jesus's promise of eternal peace especially when tempted to trust the false promises of worldly peace

### **The Promise of Eternal Peace**

God made a covenant w/ Abram that the people of Israel would be given the land between Egypt and the Euphrates river.

Initially they failed to obtain the fullness of this covenant promise, until King David. King Solomon enjoys peace in the land b/c of this.

The enjoyment of the people during the reign of King Solomon points to the eternal peace of Jesus's kingdom.

Jesus will reign as ruler over all of the people of every tongue and nation on the earth.

**V21** - As everyone came to bow down before King Solomon and offer tribute and service, so do we before King Jesus.

**V22-24** - As King Solomon had such incredible abundance and resources, King Jesus has such an incredible abundance of grace upon grace (He hears what we ask and will give it). He will provide whatever we need. If we do not have what we need under King Jesus, it is because we do not ask.

**v29-32** - As King Solomon was better than the best in terms of his wisdom, King Jesus is better than the best. He is better than anyone that could ever be held up to compare. He is the living water that is better than all other waters. The better-ness of Jesus exposes everything else as inferior.

**v33-34** - As King Solomon spoke about and subdued even the best things of the earth, King Jesus will subdue everything in creation.

### **The Temptation to Trust Worldly Peace**

**v26** - This verse is out of place, and it should not have been there. Solomon should not have had so many horses and chariots, according to Deuteronomy, but it was an indication he was trusting in the hand of man for his peace.

Likewise, we are constantly tempted to gorge ourselves on the wrong things, so we have no appetite for King Jesus.

What are we to do? We seek to revel in King Jesus and His peace, through His Word and prayer.

King Jesus offers this promise to us -- one day these temptations and trials will be over, and we will feast w/ the King.
