# Cynical Despair or Lamenting Hope
## Psalm 3

Cynicism is the "built up scar tissue from our frustrations." It claims to see "what is really going on". It won't be "fooled by faith". The cynic knows how this world works -- nothing and no one really changes.

A Lament is when "the sufferer seeks to share his suffering with God and with hope of deliverance."

Both have a realistic and authentic understanding of the difficulties and hardships of life -- BUT there is a big difference.

The Cynic -- **despairs** and **has no hope for change** -- just endures -- because **they do not bring God into their suffering.**

The Lamenter -- **seeks to share his suffering w/ God** and **has a hope of deliverance** b/c the Lord is his Shepherd.

### 1. Life
The Cynic says **"O, how many are my foes!"**

The Lamenter says **"O Lord, how many are my foes!"**

2 Samuel 16:14, David was going through a very difficult times. He "refreshed himself" not just by food and water but by turning to the Lord and lamenting before Him.

### 2. God and My Life
The Cynic says **"Don't be so naive. There is no salvation (way out). God isn't involved"**

The Lamenter says **"But you, Oh Lord, are..."**

Cynicism is the "master temptation of our age -- to keep God out of our trials.

#### Seven Aspects of God's Character and Work:

1. He is a shield around me.
2. He is "my glory" or You bestow glory on me, in the midst of great shame.
3. He is the lifter of my head.
4. He is my Sustainer.
5. He is my Answerer.
6. He is my Deliverer/Conqueror
7. He is the One who Blesses. He delights to bless.

### 3. The Response to Life
The Cynic says **"Let me tell you what’s wrong with this world and most everybody in it.  There’s no way to fix it. I guess we just have to find a way to get through it."**

The Lamenter says **"I lay down and slept...salvation belongs to the Lord and his blessing is on his people."**

The Lamenter is able to lay down and sleep after a day like that.
