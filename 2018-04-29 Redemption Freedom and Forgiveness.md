# Redemption: Freedom and Forgiveness
## Colossians 1:14

### What is redemption?

Deliverance (or liberation) from bondage (or imprisonment) by payment of a price.

Some people consider Christianity to be a "life of religious slavery", no freedom.

But, who's the slave?

1. **The compulsive gambler?** Can't stop gambling, mountains of debt.
2. **Alcoholic?** Medicates their pain/loneliness/anger/depression with alcohol, losing friends, licenses, jobs, etc?
3. **Person motivated by what other people think of you?**
4. **Sin addict?** Always thirsting for more, but leaving you empty?

There is no escape from the spiritual master of sin.

But this was the very thing that Jesus came to do, Mark 10:45 -- to give His life as a ransom for many. to free us from this slavery of sin. We are redeemed.

My relationship to sin, guilt, my old habits of sin are all different now. I have been set free from sin.

### What is redemption? The forgiveness of sin

The real issue of guilt is between me and God alone.

Redemption in its most fundamental state is forgiveness of sins -- the expunging of offense from memory and conscience.

It is not that God cannot remember your sins, it is that He chooses not to.

This means the devil no longer has a rightful rule over us. This means the Law no longer has anything to say to me, for my sins are forgiven. This means the wrath of God is removed.

### Where is redemption? "In whom," in Jesus

Believer in Christ, where are you looking? Don't look within yourself, look to Jesus! In Him you have redemption, freedom, forgiveness of sins!

Have you sinned (again)? Do you feel like you have to "punish yourself", to suffer for a little while apart from God before you go back to Him for forgiveness? No, you have been redeemed, not by your efforts, your tears, your repentance. Go to Christ!

### When is redemption? "we have redemption" -- present tense

We have redemption now.

Now when we sin, we hate it.

1 Cor. 6:20.
